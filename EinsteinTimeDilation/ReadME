# Time Dilation Simulator

This is a small interactive simulation showing how **time slows down** for a moving object, based on Einstein’s theory of Special Relativity.  

You can compare a **clock on the ground** with a **clock on a fast-moving train**. As the train speed increases, the train clock runs slower, just like in real physics.

## What You Can Do
- Change the **train speed** using the slider (0 to 0.99 × speed of light).  
- See how the **train clock falls behind** the ground clock.  
- Use the **Stop/Start button** to pause and check the clocks at any moment.

## How It Works
The simulation uses a simple formula from Special Relativity:

\[
\text{Train Time} = \frac{\text{Ground Time}}{\gamma}, \quad \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2}}
\]

Where `v` is the train speed as a fraction of the speed of light.  
The higher the speed, the slower the train clock ticks.

## Tech
- HTML + CSS for layout and styling  
- JavaScript for updating the clocks in real time
