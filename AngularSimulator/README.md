Angular Perception Simulator

This project demonstrates how perceived motion changes with distance, using a simple physics concept called angular variation.

When two objects move at the same speed, the observer does not see them moving equally fast.
Objects that are closer create a larger change in visual angle, so they appear to move faster.
Objects that are farther produce a smaller angle change and appear slower.

This simulator visualizes that idea through an interactive animation where you can:

Observe how the angle changes over time

Pause the motion to inspect the angle

Resume from the same position

See in real time how distance affects angular motion

The goal of the project is to show how physics concepts can be understood through programming, using a clear, visual model.
